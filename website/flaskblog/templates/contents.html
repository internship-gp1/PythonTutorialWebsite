As we learned in the previous page, 
Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
________________________________________
Python Indentations
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation 
is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
Example
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
Run example »
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
Example
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
Run example »

<pre>Creating variables                                                                         <button onclick="window.open('https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+data+types','_blank')" class="button button">Watch on YouTube</button>
Variables are containers for storing data values.
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
Example
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
Example
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'

________________________________________
Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules 
for Python variables:
•   A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
•   A variable name cannot start with a number
•   A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
•   Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
Remember that variable names are case-sensitive

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Python divides the operators in the following groups: 
•   Arithmetic operators
•   Assignment operators
•   Comparison operators
•   Logical operators
•   Identity operators
•   Membership operators
•   Bitwise operators

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
•   List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
•   Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
•   Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
•   Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type.
Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an 
increase in efficiency or 
security.
List
A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.
Example
Create a List:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
Run example »
________________________________________
Access Items

You access the list items by referring to the index number:
Example
Print the second item of the list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])

________________________________________
Change Item Value

To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
Example
Change the second item:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)
</pre>

<pre>A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.
Example                                                                                             <button onclick="window.open('https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+tuples','_blank')" class="button button">Watch on YouTube</button>
Create a Tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

________________________________________
Access Tuple Items
You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:
Example
Return the item in position 1:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[1])

________________________________________
Change Tuple Values
Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable.
________________________________________
________________________________________
Loop Through a Tuple
You can loop through the tuple items by using a for loop.
Example
Iterate through the items and print the values:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for x in thistuple:
  print(x)

You will learn more about for loops in our Python For Loops Chapter.
________________________________________
Check if Item Exists
To determine if a specified item is present in a tuple use the in keyword:
Example
Check if "apple" is present in the tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
if "apple" in thistuple:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits tuple")

________________________________________
Tuple Length
To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() method:
Example
Print the number of items in the tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))

________________________________________
Add Items
Once a tuple is created, you cannot add items to it. Tuples are unchangeable.
Example
You cannot add items to a tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
thistuple[3] = "orange" # This will raise an error
print(thistuple)

________________________________________
Remove Items
Note: You cannot remove items in a tuple.
 Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can delete the tuple completely:
Example
The del keyword can delete the tuple completely:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
del thistuple
print(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists

________________________________________
The tuple() Constructor
It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.
Example
Using the tuple() method to make a tuple:
thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thistuple)
</pre>
</div>
    </div>
        </div>



<div class="container bg-white">
    <div class="collapse" id="Sets">
    
        <div class="p-5 text=whit bg-successe text-white">
        <h2 ><b></h2></b>
<pre>Set                                                                                               <button onclick="window.open('https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+sets','_blank')" class="button button">Watch on YouTube</button>
A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.
Example                                                                                             
Create a Set:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)

Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
________________________________________
Access Items
You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index, since sets are unordered the items has no index.
But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, 
by using the in 
keyword.
Example
Loop through the set, and print the values:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)

Example
Check if "banana" is present in the set:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print("banana" in thisset)

________________________________________
Change Items
Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
________________________________________
Add Items
To add one item to a set use the add() method.
To add more than one item to a set use the update() method.
Example
Add an item to a set, using the add() method:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.add("orange")

print(thisset)

Example
Add multiple items to a set, using the update() method:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.update(["orange", "mango", "grapes"])

print(thisset)

________________________________________
________________________________________
Get the Length of a Set
To determine how many items a set has, use the len() method.
Example
Get the number of items in a set:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print(len(thisset))

________________________________________
Remove Item
To remove an item in a set, use the remove(), or the discard() method.
Example
Remove "banana" by using the remove() method:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.remove("banana")

print(thisset)

Note: If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.
Example
Remove "banana" by using the discard() method:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.discard("banana")

print(thisset)

Note: If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.
You can also use the pop(), method to remove an item, but this method will remove the last item. Remember
 that sets are unordered, 
so you will 
not know what item that gets removed.
The return value of the pop() method is the removed item.
Example
Remove the last item by using the pop() method:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

x = thisset.pop()

print(x)

print(thisset)

Note: Sets are unordered, so when using the pop() method, you will not know which item that gets removed.
Example
The clear() method empties the set:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.clear()

print(thisset)

Example
The del keyword will delete the set completely:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

del thisset

print(thisset)

________________________________________
The set() Constructor
It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.
Example
Using the set() constructor to make a set:
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thisset)

A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with 
curly brackets, and 
they have keys and values.
Example
Create and print a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

Run example »
________________________________________
Accessing Items
You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
Example
Get the value of the "model" key:
x = thisdict["model"]

Run example »
There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
Example
Get the value of the "model" key:
x = thisdict.get("model")

Run example »
________________________________________
________________________________________
Change Values
You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:
Example
Change the "year" to 2018:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018

Run example »
________________________________________
Loop Through a Dictionary
You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.
When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return 
the values as well.
Example
Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
  print(x)
Run example »
Example
Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])
Run example »
Example
You can also use the values() function to return values of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)
Run example »
Example
Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() function:
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)
Run example »
________________________________________
Check if Key Exists
To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:
Example
Check if "model" is present in the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")
Run example »
________________________________________
Dictionary Length
To determine how many items (key-value pairs) a dictionary has, use the len() method.
Example
Print the number of items in the dictionary:
print(len(thisdict))
Run example »
________________________________________
Adding Items
Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:
Example
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)

Run example »
________________________________________
Removing Items
There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary:
Example
The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)
Run example »
Example
The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)
Run example »
Example
The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)
Run example »
Example
The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.
Run example »
Example
The clear() keyword empties the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)
Run example »
________________________________________
Copy a Dictionary
You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, 
and changes made 
indict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.
There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy().
Example
Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)
Run example »
Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in method dict().
Example
Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a new dictionary:
Example
thisdict = dict(brand="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1964)
# note that keywords are not string literals
# note the use of equals rather than colon for the assignment
print(thisdict)


Python If ... Else
Python Conditions and If statements
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
•   Equals: a == b
•   Not Equals: a != b
•   Less than: a < b
•   Less than or equal to: a <= b
•   Greater than: a > b
•   Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
Example
If statement:
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
Run example »
In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater 
than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".

<pre>Elif                                                                                           <button onclick="window.open('https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+loops','_blank')" class="button button">Watch on YouTube</button>
The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
Example
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

Run example »
In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and
 b are equal".
________________________________________
Else
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
Example
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

Run example »
In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the 
elsecondition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".
You can also have an else without the elif:
Example
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")

Run example »
________________________________________
Short Hand If
If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.
Example
One line if statement:
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
Run example »
________________________________________
Short Hand If ... Else
If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:
Example
One line if else statement:
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
Run example »
You can also have multiple else statements on the same line:
Example
One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
Run example »
________________________________________
And
The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
Example
Test if a is greater than b, AND if c is greater than a:
if a > b and c > a:
  print("Both conditions are True")

Run example »
________________________________________
Or
The or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
Example
Test if a is greater than b, OR if a is greater than c:
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")


Python While Loops
Python Loops
Python has two primitive loop commands:
•   while loops
•   for loops
________________________________________
The while Loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
Example
Print i as long as i is less than 6:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

Run example »
Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.
The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i,
 which we set to 1.
________________________________________
The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
Example
Exit the loop when i is 3:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
Run example »
________________________________________
________________________________________
The continue Statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
Example
Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1 
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
A function can return data as a result.
________________________________________
Creating a Function
In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
Example
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
________________________________________
Calling a Function
To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
Example
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
Run example »
________________________________________
Parameters
Information can be passed to functions as parameter.
Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as 
you want, just separate them with a comma.
The following example has a function with one parameter (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a
 first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:
Example
def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")
Run example »
________________________________________
________________________________________
Default Parameter Value
The following example shows how to use a default parameter value.
If we call the function without parameter, it uses the default value:
Example
def my_function(country = "Norway"):
  print("I am from " + country)

my_function("Sweden")
my_function("India")
my_function()
my_function("Brazil")
Run example »
________________________________________
Passing a List as a Parameter
You can send any data types of parameter to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it 
will be treated as the same data type inside the function.
E.g. if you send a List as a parameter, it will still be a List when it reaches the function:
Example
def my_function(food):
  for x in food:
    print(x)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

my_function(fruits)

Run example »
________________________________________
Return Values
To let a function return a value, use the return statement:
Example
def my_function(x):
  return 5 * x

print(my_function(3))
print(my_function(5))
print(my_function(9))
Run example »
________________________________________
Recursion
Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.
Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that 
you can loop through data to reach a result.
The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or 
one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and 
mathematically-elegant approach to programming.
In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, 
which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).
To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.
Example
Recursion Example
def tri_recursion(k):
  if(k>0):
    result = k+tri_recursion(k-1)
    print(result)
  else:
    result = 0
  return result

print("\n\nRecursion Example Results")
tri_recursion(6)

<pre>Python is an object oriented programming language.                                             <button onclick="window.open('https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+classes','_blank')" class="button button">Watch on YouTube</button>
Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
________________________________________
Create a Class
To create a class, use the keyword class:
Example
Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass:
  x = 5
Run example »

</pre>
</div>
    </div>
        </div>

<div class="container bg-white">
    <div class="collapse" id="Objects">
    
        <div class="p-5 text=whit bg-successe text-white">
        <h2 ><b></h2></b>
<pre>Create Object                                                                              <button onclick="window.open('https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+objects','_blank')" class="button button">Watch on YouTube</button>
Now we can use the class named myClass to create objects:
Example
Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
Run example »
________________________________________
The __init__() Function
The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.
To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object 
is being created:
Example
Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
Run example »
Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
________________________________________
________________________________________
Object Methods
Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.
Let us create a method in the Person class:
Example
Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
Run example »
Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables 
that belong to the class.
________________________________________
The self Parameter
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs
 to the class.
It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any
 function in the class:
Example
Use the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self:
class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age

  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
Run example »
________________________________________
Modify Object Properties
You can modify properties on objects like this:
Example
Set the age of p1 to 40:
p1.age = 40
Run example »
________________________________________
Delete Object Properties
You can delete properties on objects by using the del keyword:
Example
Delete the age property from the p1 object:
del p1.age

________________________________________
Delete Objects
You can delete objects by using the del keyword:
Example
Delete the p1 object:
del p1

String Literals                                                                                     <button onclick="window.open('https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+strings','_blank')" class="button button">Watch on YouTube</button>
String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'hello' is the same as "hello".
You can display a string literal with the print() function:
Example
print("Hello")
print('Hello')
Run example »
________________________________________
Assign String to a Variable
Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
Example
a = "Hello"
print(a)
Run example »
________________________________________
Multiline Strings
You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
Example
You can use three double quotes:
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
Run example »
Or three single quotes:
Example
a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
print(a)
Run example »
Note: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in the code.

Strings are Arrays
Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
 Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

Example
Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])
Run example »
Example
Substring. Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
Run example »
Example
The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:
a = " Hello, World! "
print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"
Run example »
Example
The len() method returns the length of a string:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))
Run example »
Example
The lower() method returns the string in lower case:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())
Run example »
Example
The upper() method returns the string in upper case:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper())
Run example »
Example
The replace() method replaces a string with another string:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))
Run example »
Example
The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']
Run example »

________________________________________
String Format
As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:
Example
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
print(txt)
Run example »
But we can combine strings and numbers by using the format() method!
The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are:
Example
Use the format() method to insert numbers into strings:
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))
Run example »
The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:
Example
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
Run example »
You can use index numbers {0} to be sure the arguments are placed in the correct placeholders:
Example
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
